# Sharks
The goal is to analyze information about shark attacks and shark population levels to spread awareness that sharks do not intend to harm humans.
This analysis will look at the details of shark attacks over the years to determine the likeliness of an attack and what caused the shark to attack. 
This information will be used to show how little of a threat sharks pose to humans, and to discourage the fear and killing of sharks. 
Feel free to use any of the data or code for your own purposes, and thank you for reading.
